# Predicting-Home-Prices
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. The dataset used in this project proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.   #### Purpose: With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, in this project we will predict the final price of each home.
